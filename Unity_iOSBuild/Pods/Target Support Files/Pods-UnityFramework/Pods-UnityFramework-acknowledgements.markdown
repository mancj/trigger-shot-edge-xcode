distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies

writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of

This Section 12.1 sets forth AppsFlyer’s sole obligations and Company’s sole remedies for any claim that the Code and/or Services infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party.

12.1.3. If the Services shall be the subject of an infringement claim, or AppsFlyer reasonably believes that the Services shall be the subject of an infringement claim, AppsFlyer may terminate this Agreement with written notice if modification of the Services to be non-infringing is not reasonably practical.

The obligations of either party to provide indemnification under this Agreement will be contingent upon the indemnified party (i) providing the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that the indemnified party’s failure to notify the indemnifying party will not diminish the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Section 12 except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure), (ii) cooperating fully with the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s expense), and (iii) allowing the indemnifying party to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that no settlement may be entered into without the consent of the indemnified party if such settlement would require any action on the part of the indemnified party other than to cease using any allegedly infringing or illegal content or services. Subject to the foregoing, an indemnified party will at all times have the option to participate in any matter or litigation through counsel of its own selection at its own expense.

13. Disclaimer of Warranties.

Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement may not be modified or amended except in a writing executed by both parties.

17.2. All waivers must be in writing. A waiver of any default hereunder or of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a continuing waiver or a waiver of any other default or of any other term or condition, but shall apply solely to the instance to which such waiver is directed. AppsFlyer may provide Company with notices required hereunder by contacting Company at any email address Company provided, including in its registration information.

17.3. Neither Party may assign any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party, such consent not to be required in the event of an assignment by one of the Parties to a purchaser of all or substantially all of the assignor’s assets or share capital. The assignor shall provide the other Party with written notice of the assignment. Assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void.

17.4. If any part of this Agreement shall be invalid or unenforceable, such part shall be interpreted to give the maximum force possible to such terms as possible under applicable law, and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other part or provision of this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.
17.5. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, and the competent courts in the city of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising hereunder.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This license is primarily applicable to several proprietary components, owned by more than one entity of the Fyber Group, which are not open sourced. If applicable, the Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software.

1. Definitions.

1.1 “Open Source Software” includes, without limitation, a software license that requires as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution of such software that such software or other software incorporated into, derived from or distributed with such software be (a) disclosed or distributed in source code form; (b) be licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (c) be redistributable at no charge.

1.2 “Fyber Group” means any entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Fyber N.V to this Agreement, but only for so long as such control exists, and where “control” shall mean ownership of more than 50% of the stock or other equity interests entitled to vote for the election of directors or an equivalent governing body.

1.3 “Fyber SDK” includes the documentation, software, both source code and object code, sample applications, emulator, tools, libraries, APIs, data, and materials provided by the Fyber Group to You for use in connection with Your mobile application, and includes any updates that may be provided by the Fyber Group.

1.4 “Fyber Services” by integrating the Fyber SDK with your mobile application, you will be able to use the Fyber services (subject to entering into a commercial agreement with Fyber pertaining to such services), which will enable you to sell your mobile application ad space inventory to advertisers programmatically.

1.5 “You” (or “Your”) shall mean an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License.

2. License Grant.

2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Fyber Group hereby grants to You a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable and worldwide license to download and use the SDK for the sole purpose of connecting to and using the Fyber Services.

3. Restrictions.

3.1 Except for the limited license granted to You herein, You agree that all right, title and interest in and to the Fyber SDK including the concepts and technology inherent in them, trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, are, and at all times shall remain, the sole and exclusive property of the Fyber Group. Except to the extent permitted under this Agreement or by applicable law, You shall not (i) modify, reverse engineer or disassemble any portion of the Fyber SDK; (ii) lease, rent, copy, redistribute or sublicense the Fyber SDK to third party; or (iii) remove, efface or obscure any copyright notices, logos or other proprietary notices or legends included in the FYBER SDK. You may not use any component part of the Fyber SDK in any way independent from the Fyber SDK. You may not load or install any of the Fyber SDK onto any other devices, except on Your mobile application.

3.2 The Fyber Group may extend, enhance, or otherwise modify the Fyber SDK at any time without notice. If updates are made available by the Fyber Group, the terms of this Agreement will govern such updates, unless the update is accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. The Fyber Group is not obligated to provide any maintenance, technical or other support for the Fyber SDK. You acknowledge that the Fyber Group has no express or implied obligation to announce or make available any updates to the Fyber SDK.

4. Use of the Fyber SDK.

4.1 Your Application(s) must not (i) breach any applicable laws, regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the applicable jurisdictions; (ii) contain any material, component or code which could damage, destroy, unduly burden or unreasonably affect software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks; or (iii) disable, hack or otherwise interfere with any authentication, content protection, digital signing, digital rights management, security or verification mechanisms implemented in or by the Fyber Group and/or the Fyber Services.

4.2 Your mobile application(s) must not breach any applicable laws, regulations or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the applicable jurisdictions or disable, unduly burden or unreasonably interfere with software, firmware, hardware, data, systems, services, or networks.

5.1 You hereby acknowledge that the Fyber SDK may contain Open Source Software.

To the extent any such license requires that the Fyber Group provides You the rights to copy, modify, distribute or otherwise use any Open Source Software that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to You in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable Open Source Software license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such Open Source Software.

5.2 You acknowledge that the Open Source Software license is solely between You and the applicable Open Source Software. You shall comply with the terms of all applicable Open Source Software licenses, if any.

6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

7. Indemnification.

7.1 You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Fyber Group from any claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, suits or expenditures incurred by the Fyber Group, as a result of any infringement or alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of a third party caused by or arising out of, resulting from, or related to failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to (1) the clauses directed to combining the SDK with Open Source Software, (2) unauthorized use or disclosure of SDK, and (3) use of SDK in combination with software, hardware, systems, or other items not provided by the Fyber Group.

9. Term and Termination.

9.1 Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of your acceptance of the terms of this Agreement or your use of the Fyber SDK and continue until (a) terminated by either You or the Fyber Group; or (b) termination or expiration of your agreement with the Fyber Group.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

### 4.	Advertising via The Vungle Platform. 
A.	Vungle Insertion & Sale of Ads.  Developer hereby grants Vungle the right to sell, and have sold, advertisement inventory in the Developer Apps, and to insert Vungle Ads within such inventory.  Developer agrees that in connection with Vungle Ads, Vungle may access or call to the Developer Apps, or the servers that make them available, and cause the routing, transmission, reproduction, and display of Vungle Ads as contemplated herein.  Unless expressly agreed in writing, Vungle makes no guarantee that any level or amount of Vungle Ads will be placed in the Developer Apps.  In addition, Developer hereby grants Vungle the non-exclusive, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, distribute and display Developer’s and the Developer Apps’ trademarks, names, logos, and images of the Developer Apps, in connection with the sale of Vungle Ads hereunder, including (a) listing the Developer Apps and inventory in pitch materials to prospective Advertisers; (b) reporting the inclusion of Developer Apps and inventory as part of Vungle’s advertising network, and (c) identifying the Developer as a publishing partner on Vungle’s website and other marketing materials.

B.	Developer Apps Content Policy.  The Developer Apps will not contain, consist of, or promote discrimination, illegal activities, hate speech, defamation, graphic violence, firearms, tobacco, illegal drugs, pornography, sex-trafficking, profanity, obscenity or sexually explicit material (“Developer Apps Content Policy”).  Additionally, Developer will notify Vungle immediately of any Developer Apps relating to alcohol or real-money gambling.  Developer agrees that Vungle has no responsibility for the Developer Apps, including any content therein, and Vungle has no obligation or ability to monitor or edit the Developer Apps.  Developer will provide as much advance written notice as reasonably practicable, but in no event less than fifteen (15) days’ notice, regarding any material changes to the nature or design of any Developer App, including without limitation, changes to the placement of inventory, any action that will increase or reduce expected inventory within the Developer Apps, the type of content contained within the Developer Apps, or the target audience of the Developer Apps. 

C.	Ad Restrictions; Invalid Impressions.  Developer may not, and may not authorize or encourage any third party to: (i) engage in or create Invalid Impressions; (ii) edit, modify, filter, or change the order of the information contained in any Vungle Ad, or remove, obscure or minimize any Vungle Ad in any way; and/or (iii) redirect an end user away from any web page or app accessed by an end user after selecting or clicking on any part of a Vungle Ad (“Advertiser Page”), provide a version of the Advertiser Page different from the page an end user would access by going directly to the Advertiser Page, or intersperse any content between the Vungle Ads and the Advertiser Page.  As used herein, “Invalid Impressions” means any impressions, downloads, installs, views, taps, clicks or other user engagement relating to any Vungle Ad campaign that may artificially inflate an Advertiser's costs or Developer's earnings. By way of example, and without limitation, Invalid Impressions are caused by: (1) repeated manual clicks, (2) using “robots”, “spiders” or other tools for making automated computer generated requests, (3) using offers of cash, prizes, incentives, gift cards, vouchers or anything of value, including cryptocurrency, (4) using a design that encourages or is likely to lead to unintended impressions, downloads, installs, views, taps, clicks or other user actions, (5) manipulating or misrepresenting device IDs, Ad IDs, geolocation or other user or device information; (6) hijacking of an end user’s device; (7) automatic advertisement refreshes; or (8) any other deceptive or fraudulent methods.  Developer shall promptly notify Vungle if it suspects that any third party may be tampering with, abusing or manipulating the Vungle Platform or the Vungle Ads within the Developer App, or otherwise violating the restrictions of this Section 4.C.  Vungle may suspend Developer’s use of the Vungle Platform and/or terminate this Agreement immediately should Developer violate the foregoing provisions of this Section, or if Vungle observes unusually high levels of impressions, downloads, installs, views, taps or clicks on Developer’s account. Developer shall not be entitled to any revenue associated with Invalid Impressions or campaigns associated with violations of this Section 4.C.

D.	Developer Ad Campaigns.  In the event that Developer desires to become an Advertiser, and advertise its app within the Vungle network of publishers, the parties will enter into a separate mutually agreed upon insertion order.

### 5.	Data & Privacy.
A.	Collection of Data.  Developer acknowledges and agrees that Vungle may: (i) use the Vungle Property to collect and use App Data and Performance Data in connection with the performance of this Agreement, including to display Vungle Ads to end users and to measure and report the performance of Vungle Ads; (ii) disclose App Data and Performance Data (a) to third parties (including Advertisers and attribution partners) as reasonably necessary in connection with the operation of the Vungle Platform and performance of this Agreement, (b) if required by any court order, process, law or governmental agency; or (c) generally, when such data is aggregated, so that the specific information relating to Developer is not identified as such; and (iii) use App Data and Performance Data for Vungle’s internal business purposes, including to develop and improve the Vungle SDK and Vungle Platform, perform internal analytics regarding Vungle SDK performance, and to monitor for errors.  Vungle will collect and use the App Data and Performance Data in accordance with Vungle’s Privacy Notice, which is available at http://vungle.com/privacy/ (as updated from time to time).  This Section 5.A. shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

B.	Compliance with Privacy Laws.  In performance of this Agreement, Developer agrees to comply with all applicable laws, governmental regulations, court or government agency orders, and decrees relating in any manner to the collection, use, or dissemination of data from or about users, user traffic, or otherwise relating to privacy rights, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).  In addition, Developer agrees to conspicuously post a privacy notice that accurately describes the Developer’s and third parties’ collection, use, and disclosure of end user data from the Developer Apps, which include disclosure (i) that third parties may collect or receive information and use that information to provide measurement services and targeted ads, and (ii) how and where users can opt-out of collection and use of information for ad targeting.  Developer will not pass any personally-identifiable information to Vungle unless expressly permitted in writing, and except as permitted under and in compliance with applicable law. Vungle reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate this Agreement should Developer violate this Section, and/or to remain compliant with law.  

C.	Vungle Data Privacy Addendum. As applicable, and to the extent performance of this Agreement entails the collection and/or processing of any data or information from end users in the European Economic Area, the parties agree that the additional terms and conditions set forth in the Vungle Data Privacy Addendum (“DPA”) attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit A apply to this Agreement.  To the extent this Agreement conflicts with the DPA, the DPA shall govern and control.

### 6.	Developer Fees; Payment. 
A.	Standard Developer Fee.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Vungle shall pay to Developer a percentage of the Net Revenue (the “Developer Fee”), as determined by Vungle.  “Net Revenue” means the gross revenue actually collected by Vungle from Advertisers for Vungle Ads served and displayed within the Developer Apps, less (i) any refunds to Advertisers; (ii) a deduction of up to 10% to cover expenses related to Advertiser discounts, payment transaction fees, telecommunications, data center and other serving costs, (iii) any amounts payable by Vungle to providers of targeting, reporting, verification or other data, technology or services used in connection with a given campaign hereunder, and (iv) Invalid Impressions. The Developer Fee shall be based on the impression or app installation counts used by the applicable Advertiser(s).  For the avoidance of doubt, all Developer Fees are based on advertisement requests from the Developer Apps that are actually fulfilled with Vungle Ads.  All revenue received from activities that Vungle deems to be due to fraud, Invalid Impressions, or technical error may be refunded to the Advertiser(s) in Vungle’s sole discretion.

B.	Developer Fee Addendums. During the Term of this Agreement, the parties may enter into one or more separate written publisher addendums (each a, “Fee Addendum”) setting forth modifications to the Developer Fee, bonus fees, or other incentives for a limited time period and/or specific advertising campaign. Each Fee Addendum shall, upon full execution by the parties, become a part of this Agreement and subject to all of its terms and conditions.

C.	Payment Terms; Taxes. Vungle will pay any Developer Fee due to Developer sixty (60) days’ after the completion of the month in which such Vungle Ads are served and displayed; provided that, Vungle may withhold payment until the following month for Developer Fee amounts less than $50 U.S.  Developer shall be responsible for any bank, transfer or transaction fees (e.g., PayPal).  Vungle may deduct any withholding, sales, value added, and other applicable taxes (other than its net income taxes) as required by law. Specifically, Vungle will deduct withholding tax, unless Developer provides a certification to Vungle, upon execution of this Agreement, certifying that Developer and the Developer Apps perform wholly outside of the U.S.  Developer is responsible for paying, and will indemnify and hold Vungle forever harmless for, any taxes, duties, or fees, including interest and penalties, for which Developer is legally responsible, or that result from an inaccurate certification where Developer or the Developer Apps do in fact perform within the U.S.    

### 7.	Term and Termination.
A.	Term. This Agreement is effective until terminated in accordance with this Agreement.

B.	Termination/Suspension by Vungle.  Vungle may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing sixty (60) days’ notice to Developer.  Additionally, Vungle may terminate this Agreement immediately if Developer breaches any provision of this Agreement.  Vungle may immediately suspend Developer’s access to the Vungle Platform if Vungle reasonably believes Developer has breached this Agreement.

C.	Termination by Developer.

D.	Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement by Developer, the Agreement (including all rights and licenses granted and obligations assumed hereunder) will remain in force and effect until the completion of all Vungle Ad campaigns associated with the Developer Apps in effect on the date of such termination (“Sell-Off Period”).

Upon any termination of this Agreement, each party will promptly return or destroy all copies of any Confidential Information in its possession or control. Sections 3, 5(A), 6(C), 7(D) through 13 shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.

### 8.	Confidentiality.
A.	Definition. “Confidential Information” means any and all business, technical and financial information or material of a party, whether revealed orally, visually, or in tangible or electronic form, that is not generally known to the public, which is disclosed to or made available by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other, or which one party becomes aware of pursuant to this Agreement (the “Receiving Party”).  The Vungle SDK is Vungle’s Confidential Information, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain confidential.  The failure of a Disclosing Party to designate as “confidential” any such information or material at the time of disclosure shall not result in a loss of status as Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party.  Confidential Information shall not include information which: (i) is in or has entered the public domain through no breach of this Agreement or other act by a Receiving Party; (ii) a Receiving Party rightfully knew prior to the time that it was disclosed to a Receiving Party hereunder; (iii) a Receiving Party received without restriction from a third-party lawfully possessing and lawfully entitled to disclose such information without breach of this Agreement; or (iv) was independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information.

B.	Use and Disclosure Restrictions. The Receiving Party shall not use the Confidential Information except as necessary to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement, and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party, except to those of its employees, subcontractors, and advisors that need to know such Confidential Information for the purposes of this Agreement, provided that each such employee, subcontractor, and advisor is subject to a written agreement that includes binding use and disclosure restrictions that are at least as protective of the Confidential Information as those set forth herein.  The Receiving Party will use at least the efforts such party ordinarily uses with respect to its own confidential information of similar nature and importance to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information in its possession or control, but in no event less than reasonable efforts.  The foregoing obligations will not restrict the Receiving Party from disclosing any Confidential Information required by applicable law; provided that, the Receiving Party must use reasonable efforts to give the Disclosing Party advance notice thereof (i.e., so as to afford Disclosing Party an opportunity to intervene and seek an order or other relief for protecting its Confidential Information from any unauthorized use or disclosure) and the Confidential Information is only disclosed to the extent required by law.  The Receiving Party shall return all of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to the Disclosing Party or destroy the same, no later than fifteen (15) days after Disclosing Party’s request, or when Receiving Party no longer needs Confidential Information for its authorized purposes hereunder.

### 9.	Representations and Warranties of Developer.  
Developer represents, warrants and covenants to Vungle that: (a) it shall comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations with respect to the operation of its business and its use of the Vungle SDK and Vungle Platform; (b) it has all necessary rights, title, and interest in and to the Developer Apps, and it has obtained all necessary rights, releases, and permissions to grant the rights granted to Vungle in this Agreement, including to allow Vungle to sell and insert the Vungle Ads as contemplated herein; (c) the Developer Apps will comply with the Developer Apps Content Policy, and will not infringe upon, violate, or misappropriate any third party right, including any intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights; (d) any App Data Developer may provide to Vungle, and the ability for Vungle to collect App Data and Performance Data, is permitted under Developer’s privacy notice and provided in compliance with all applicable laws; and (e) it has made any and all disclosures and obtained any and all consents or permissions required by applicable laws with respect to Developer’s privacy practices, including without limitation: (i) any end user data Developer collects, uses, and/or discloses, (ii) the use and disclosure of App Data and Performance Data to Vungle via the Vungle SDK and Vungle Platform, and (iii) notice and parental consent required by applicable privacy laws, including COPPA.

If Developer is unable to comply with its notice and consent obligations under this Addendum, Developer shall promptly notify Vungle and Vungle may elect to perform any one or all of the obligations provided Developer does not prevent Vungle from performing such obligations. In the event neither party is able to perform such obligations, Vungle shall have the right to terminate the Agreement without liability upon written notice.

4.5.	Prohibited Data Sharing.  Developer shall not: (i) share with Vungle any Personal Data that allows users of Developer Apps to be directly identified (for example, by reference to their name or email address); and (ii) pass to Vungle any personal data of children (as such term is defined under applicable Privacy Requirements), unless expressly agreed in writing and as permitted under Privacy Requirements. Upon request, Vungle shall provide Developer with such reasonable assistance as Developer may require to enable Developer to provide such notice and obtain such consents.

For these purposes, the parties acknowledge and agree that Vungle shall provide adequate protection for any EEA Personal Data by virtue of Vungle having self-certified its compliance with the Privacy Shield. Vungle agrees to protect EEA Personal Data in accordance with the requirements of the Privacy Shield Principles.

### 7.	Vungle Data.
To the extent Vungle shares any Personal Data with Developer in connection with the Vungle SDK and Vungle Platform, the parties agree that (i) Developer shall process such data as a separate and independent Controller (where applicable Privacy Requirements recognize such concept) for the limited purpose of performance under this Agreement consistent with the consents given by the data subjects; and (ii) Developer shall be independently responsible for the obligations that apply to it as a Controller under the Privacy Requirements. Developer further acknowledges that Vungle is self-certifying its compliance to the Privacy Shield and may transfer to Developer Personal Data protected by EU Data Protection Laws. To the extent Developer processes any such data, Developer agrees to provide the same level of protection for such Personal Data as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles. Developer shall notify Vungle if it makes a determination that it can no longer provide such protection and in such event, shall cease processing or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate (if remediable) any processing until such time as the processing meets the level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles.  

### 8.	Miscellaneous.
8.1.	Vungle reserves the right to modify, suspend or terminate the Agreement should Developer violate this Addendum.

8.2.	This Addendum shall survive termination or expiry of the Agreement.  Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, Vungle may continue to process the Ad Data provided that such processing complies with the requirements of this Addendum and the Privacy Requirements.

                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
