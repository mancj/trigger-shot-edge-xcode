/**
 Built in coder using ImageIO that supports animated GIF encoding/decoding
 @note `SDImageIOCoder` supports GIF but only as static (will use the 1st frame).
 @note Use `SDImageGIFCoder` for fully animated GIFs. For `UIImageView`, it will produce animated `UIImage`(`NSImage` on macOS) for rendering. For `SDAnimatedImageView`, it will use `BU_SDAnimatedImage` for rendering.
 @note The recommended approach for animated GIFs is using `BU_SDAnimatedImage` with `SDAnimatedImageView`. It's more performant than `UIImageView` for GIF displaying(especially on memory usage)
