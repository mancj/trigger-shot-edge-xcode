/**
 A subclass of `NSBitmapImageRep` to fix that GIF loop count issue because `NSBitmapImageRep` will reset `NSImageCurrentFrameDuration` by using `kCGImagePropertyGIFDelayTime` but not `kCGImagePropertyGIFUnclampedDelayTime`.
 Built in GIF coder use this instead of `NSBitmapImageRep` for better GIF rendering. If you do not want this, only enable `SDImageIOCoder`, which just call `NSImage` API and actually use `NSBitmapImageRep` for GIF image.
 This also support APNG format using `SDImageAPNGCoder`. Which provide full alpha-channel support and the correct duration match the `kPAGCGImagePropertyAPNGUnclampedDelayTime`.
